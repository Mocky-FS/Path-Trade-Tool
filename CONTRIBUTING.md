# Contributing to Path Trade Tools

Thanks for your interest! 🙂

## Current Status

This project is in early development (V2.0 foundation phase). I'm currently establishing:
- Architecture patterns (Clean Architecture)
- Coding standards
- Testing strategies

## Future Contributions

External contributions will be welcomed once the foundation is stable (estimated: Phase 3+).

For now, feel free to:
- ⭐ Star the repo
- 👀 Watch for updates
- 💬 Open discussions for feature ideas

I'll update this file with detailed contribution guidelines when ready!
